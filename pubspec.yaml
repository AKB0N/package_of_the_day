  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/audios/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/banner/
    - assets/svg/
    - assets/images/rflutter_alert/
    - assets/images/staggered_grid_view/
    - assets/images/audioplayer/
    - assets/images/onboarding/
    - assets/images/intro_slider/
    - assets/images/parallax_animation/
    - assets/images/foods/
    - assets/images/background/
    - assets/videos/
    - assets/images/introduction_screen/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NeumorphicIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NeumorphicIcons.ttf

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
